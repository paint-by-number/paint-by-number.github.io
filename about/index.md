## ABOUT US
[Huyen (Elise) Le](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huyentle) is a young professional in international development in Washington D.C. An avid follower of the NYTimes and The Economist graphics, she’s inspired to  explore the use of data visualization in making economic information more accessible in the development world. A STATA user by trade, she hopes to pick up R and D3 skills through this blog.

[Anh (Andy) Le](https://people.duke.edu/~aql3) is a PhD candidate in Political Science at Duke University. As a bored senior done with grad school application, he signed up for a programming class and got hooked ever since. When he’s not glued to the computer doing research, he’s glued to the computer playing Dota 2. Through this blog, he hopes to entice his girlfriend (a STATA user by trade) towards the wonders of R.

We both grew up in Hanoi, Vietnam before coming to the U.S. for education, as you probably see from the substantive focus of our blog.
