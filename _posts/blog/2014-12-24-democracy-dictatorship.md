I plot [the evolution of democracy and dictatorship](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/paint-by-number/visualization-code/blob/master/worldmap_shiny/index.html) in the world over time and across continents. On the right is the list of dictatorships to show how some collapse and emerge.

(The visualization is too big to view here.)
